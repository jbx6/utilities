# utilities

 • an assortment of random scripts which do useful things, etc.
 • n.b. these are not 'utility scrips' in the truest sense, rather they provide utility to me...

## usage
1. download script;
2. navigate to directory within which script is stored (e.g. ` cd path/to/downloads`)
3. run with `node <filename>` (e.g. `node job.js`)
